# CARES BINGO SNOW

My wife asked me to create a collection of Christmas-themed BINGO cards for
our party tonight. I only have a few hours to prepare it so I wanted to create
a generator that would randomize some images and spit them out on a card for
us to print off.

## STEPS

* I am going to create a mockup in HTML and have my wife validate the design
* I will then generate cards with the images in random spots on each card
